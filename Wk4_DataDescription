The same data will be leveraged from what we have been seeing in the previous modules. In addition to it, I will be using the additinal data to calculate the area of the city/town.

The foursquare data will be used to get the hosptials/clinics in the city. And then comparing against the size of the city, the ratio will be calculated for many cities across the US/world.
